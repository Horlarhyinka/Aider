        content: `Hi brayden, your report suggests your emergency is a car accident. Here are some tips to help you manage your condition.Providing first aid for a car accident victim is crucial and can potentially save lives. Here are the initial steps to take:

        1. Assess the Scene: Ensure your safety first. Check for any immediate dangers like oncoming traffic or fire.
        
        2. Call for Help: Dial emergency services immediately (e.g., 911 or local emergency number) to request an ambulance and police assistance.
        
        3. Approach the Victim Safely: Approach the victim carefully. Check for responsiveness by gently shaking and asking, "Are you okay?" Do not move the person if you suspect a spinal injury unless they are in immediate danger.
        
        4. Control Bleeding: If the victim is bleeding, apply direct pressure to the wound with a clean cloth or bandage to stop the bleeding. Elevate the injured limb if possible.
        
        5. Check Breathing and Airway: Ensure the person is breathing. If not breathing normally, begin CPR if you are trained to do so.
        
        6. Manage Shock: Keep the victim calm and reassure them while waiting for help. Lay them down, elevate their legs slightly, and cover them with a blanket to prevent shock.
        
        7. Stabilize Injuries: Avoid moving the victim unnecessarily, especially if there are suspected head, neck, or spinal injuries. If you must move them, do so gently and support the head and neck.
        
        8. Keep Warm: Cover the person with a blanket or clothing to maintain body temperature.
        
        9. Provide Emotional Support: Stay with the victim and offer comfort and reassurance until medical help arrives.
        
        Remember, it's important to act quickly but also to avoid causing further harm. If you're not trained in first aid or emergency care, do your best to assist while waiting for professional help to arrive.`
